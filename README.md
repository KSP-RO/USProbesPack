This pack will include pretty much all probes ever launched by NASA and the US military. It is a long term project and I will be adding to it slowly over time.

##Remotetech Support:
* If you use remotetech, here is a module manager config to make the probes compatible: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pgwigx27ffp6ta/US_Probes_RT.cfg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pgwigx27ffp6ta/US_Probes_RT.cfg?dl=0)

##NOTES

* For Pioneer 10/11 place the ASAS module UPSIDE DOWN radially on the front "black area" of the probe. Without this you will need to control the probe backwards once in orbit
* Pioneer 0-2 has 3 parts, the main body, the decoupler and the retro boosters
* Probes are modeled in 1:1 scale and scaled down for KSP to be compatible with the rest of my parts which meet the ISS community pack guidelines of 64%
* Probes are VERY small, as this is realistic so you will need to zoom in a lot to use
